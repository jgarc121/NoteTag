🧱 Architecture

NoteTag is built with scalability in mind using modular Swift best practices:
	•	Modularization via Swift Packages
The app is split into feature-based Swift Packages, making the codebase more organized, testable, and scalable.
	•	Routing System
A lightweight internal router helps manage navigation between views cleanly. This improves separation of concerns and makes deep linking or conditional flows easier.
	•	Subview Composition
Views are broken down into reusable subviews for improved code clarity and reuse. This keeps each screen focused and maintainable.
